This repo consists configs and scripts for flash 
Tevo Black Widow 3D printer with fresh firmware from 
Marlin repo.

Usual workflow is change variables in 
build-fresh-tevo-marlin-firmware and run it. Then 
complite with Arduino IDE HEX file and run ./flash

Also you can update/repair uploader firmware with
./flash-uploader and USBasp programmer.

Any pull requests and thankful words are wellcome.
